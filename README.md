## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform analysis on a retail orders dataset, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and querying using SQL. The project demonstrates steps to:
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data into an SQLite database
- Perform data queries for business insights

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is hosted on Kaggle and contains information about retail orders, including:
- Order dates
- Shipping modes
- Product categories and costs
- Customer segments
